# Voice-Recon-Male-vs-Female-
A machine learning project for voice classification using scikit-learn and librosa. It extracts audio features like mean frequency, spectral entropy, flatness, and centroid, applies Standard Scaling, and predicts voice characteristics using a trained model. The classifier is saved using joblib and can analyze new audio files.
